I help teams choose the right materials, tighten development workflows, and translate lab results into reliable production — so new parts launch on time, at target cost, and with consistent quality.",

    "After completing an M.Sc. in Polymer Sciences I moved between lab, R&D and production roles to learn both the science and the system around plastics — from formulation and analytical testing to production interfaces and complaint management. That blend of hands-on polymer knowledge and cross-department coordination is how I spot the small process changes that have outsized operational impact.",
    "Since 2022 I’ve co-led technology and development at a plastics manufacturer, heading interdisciplinary projects (including a publicly-funded consortium project with a total volume of €10M) and advising customers, procurement and sales on material choice and processing guidelines. I pair that experience with a pragmatic, data-driven approach — including small automation and Python tools I developed to monitor inventory and quality — so recommendations are actionable, measurable and repeatable.",
    "My mission as a consultant is simple: remove friction between R&D and production. I work with teams to accelerate decision-making, reduce rework, and put robust processes in place so innovations become products — not perpetual prototypes."
